# Field Mapping Integration - COMPLETE ✅

## Files Successfully Updated

I've directly updated your project files:

### 1. ✅ `/Users/ridiculaptop/Downloads/claude_code_tripbuilder/tripbuilder/services/ghl_sync.py`

**Updated Methods:**

#### `sync_trip_opportunities()` - Now uses field mapping utilities:
```python
# Parse and map custom fields using field_mapping utilities
custom_fields_list = opp_data.get('customFields', [])
custom_fields_dict = parse_ghl_custom_fields(custom_fields_list)
mapped_fields = map_trip_custom_fields(custom_fields_dict)

# Set basic fields
trip.name = opp_data.get('name', 'Unknown Trip')
trip.destination = custom_fields_dict.get('opportunity.tripname', trip.name)

# Apply all mapped custom fields
for column, value in mapped_fields.items():
    if hasattr(trip, column) and value is not None:
        setattr(trip, column, value)
```

**This automatically maps 30+ custom fields including:**
- arrival_date, return_date (dates)
- max_passengers, passenger_count (capacity)
- trip_vendor, vendor_terms (vendor info)
- trip_standard_level_pricing (pricing)
- lodging, nights_total, travel_category (trip details)

#### `sync_passenger_opportunities()` - Now uses field mapping utilities:
```python
# Set basic fields from contact
passenger.firstname = contact.firstname
passenger.lastname = contact.lastname
passenger.email = contact.email
passenger.phone = contact.phone

# Parse and map custom fields using field_mapping utilities
custom_fields_list = opp_data.get('customFields', [])
custom_fields_dict = parse_ghl_custom_fields(custom_fields_list)
mapped_fields = map_passenger_custom_fields(custom_fields_dict)

# Apply all mapped custom fields
for column, value in mapped_fields.items():
    if hasattr(passenger, column) and value is not None:
        setattr(passenger, column, value)
```

**This automatically maps 25+ custom fields including:**
- passport_number, passport_expire, passport_country (passport)
- health_state, health_medical_info, medication_list (health)
- contact1_ufirst_name, contact1_ulast_name, contact1_uphone, etc. (emergency contact - 10+ fields)
- user_roomate, room_occupancy (room preferences)
- form_submitted_date, passenger_signature (legal)

### 2. ✅ `/Users/ridiculaptop/Downloads/claude_code_tripbuilder/tripbuilder/app.py`

**Updated `sync_ghl_command()` to display:**
```python
print(f"  Trips: {results.get('trips', 0)}")
print(f"  Passengers: {results.get('passengers', 0)}")
```

## What Changed

### Before:
- Manual field mapping in sync methods
- Only 3-5 fields per entity synced
- Date parsing in multiple places
- No type conversion

### After:
- Centralized field mapping via `field_mapping.py`
- 30+ trip fields and 25+ passenger fields synced
- Automatic type conversion (dates, integers, decimals, booleans)
- Consistent field handling across all syncs

---

## Next Steps - Run the Sync!

### Step 1: Open Terminal and Navigate to Project

```bash
cd /Users/ridiculaptop/Downloads/claude_code_tripbuilder/tripbuilder
```

### Step 2: Activate Virtual Environment

```bash
source ../.venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 3: Run Sync

```bash
flask sync-ghl
```

### Expected Output:

```

## Verification - Check Database

After sync completes, open PostgreSQL:

```bash
psql -U ridiculaptop -d tripbuilder
```

### Check Trip Fields Are Populated:

```sql
-- See trips with all custom fields
SELECT 
    id, 
    name, 
    destination,
    arrival_date, 
    return_date,
    max_passengers,
    passenger_count,
    trip_vendor,
    trip_standard_level_pricing,
    travel_category,
    lodging,
    nights_total
FROM trips 
WHERE arrival_date IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 5;

-- Count trips with each field populated
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_trips,
    COUNT(arrival_date) as has_arrival_date,
    COUNT(return_date) as has_return_date,
    COUNT(max_passengers) as has_capacity,
    COUNT(trip_vendor) as has_vendor,
    COUNT(trip_standard_level_pricing) as has_pricing,
    COUNT(lodging) as has_lodging,
    COUNT(travel_category) as has_category
FROM trips;
```

**Expected:** Most trips should have dates, capacity, and vendor info populated.

### Check Passenger Fields Are Populated:

```sql
-- See passengers with all custom fields
SELECT 
    id, 
    firstname, 
    lastname,
    email,
    passport_number,
    passport_country,
    passport_expire,
    health_state,
    medication_list,
    contact1_ufirst_name,
    contact1_uphone,
    room_occupancy
FROM passengers 
WHERE passport_number IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 5;

-- Count passengers with each field populated
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_passengers,
    COUNT(passport_number) as has_passport,
    COUNT(passport_country) as has_country,
    COUNT(health_state) as has_health,
    COUNT(medication_list) as has_medications,
    COUNT(contact1_ufirst_name) as has_emergency_contact,
    COUNT(room_occupancy) as has_room_pref
FROM passengers;
```

**Expected:** Many passengers should have passport info, some have health/emergency contact details.

### Check Trip-Passenger Linkage:

```sql
-- See how many passengers are linked per trip
SELECT 
    t.name as trip_name,
    t.destination,
    t.arrival_date,
    COUNT(p.id) as passenger_count,
    t.max_passengers as capacity
FROM trips t
LEFT JOIN passengers p ON p.trip_id = t.id
GROUP BY t.id, t.name, t.destination, t.arrival_date, t.max_passengers
HAVING COUNT(p.id) > 0
ORDER BY passenger_count DESC
LIMIT 20;

-- Count passengers with/without trip links
SELECT 
    COUNT(CASE WHEN trip_id IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) as linked,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN trip_id IS NULL THEN 1 END) as unlinked
FROM passengers;
```

**Expected:** Some passengers will be linked, many may be unlinked (normal - we'll improve linking in Stage 2B).

---

## Success Criteria

✅ **Sync completes without errors**  
✅ **Record counts match expectations:**
   - 2 pipelines, 11 stages
   - 53 custom fields
   - ~5,453 contacts
   - ~693 trips  
   - ~6,477 passengers

✅ **Trip fields populated:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM trips WHERE arrival_date IS NOT NULL;
-- Should be 690+
```

✅ **Passenger fields populated:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM passengers WHERE passport_number IS NOT NULL;
-- Should be several hundred
```

✅ **Some passengers linked to trips:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM passengers WHERE trip_id IS NOT NULL;
-- Should be at least some percentage
```

## If You Encounter Issues

### Issue: "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'field_mapping'"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Make sure you're in the right directory
cd /Users/ridiculaptop/Downloads/claude_code_tripbuilder/tripbuilder
ls -la field_mapping.py  # Should exist

# Make sure virtual environment is activated
source ../.venv/bin/activate
which python  # Should show path in .venv
```

### Issue: "Column does not exist"

**Solution:** Database schema not updated. Recreate database:
```bash
python3 recreate_db.py
flask sync-ghl
```

### Issue: Sync hangs or times out

**Solution:** Network or GHL API issue. Try:
```bash
# Test API connection
python3 -c "from ghl_api import GoHighLevelAPI; import os; from dotenv import load_dotenv; load_dotenv(); api = GoHighLevelAPI(os.getenv('GHL_LOCATION_ID'), os.getenv('GHL_API_TOKEN')); print('Connected' if api.get_pipelines() else 'Failed')"

# If connected, try sync again
flask sync-ghl
```

---

## What's Next

After verifying the sync works:

### Stage 2B: Trip Creation (Local → GHL)
- Create TripBooking opportunity when trip created locally
- Map local trip fields back to GHL custom fields
- Bidirectional sync

### Stage 2C: Passenger Enrollment (Local → GHL)  
- Create Passenger opportunity when passenger enrolls
- Map local passenger fields back to GHL
- Link to correct trip

### Passenger-Trip Linking Improvements
- Create script to link unlinked passengers
- Better fuzzy matching algorithm
- UI for manual linking

## Summary

🎉 **Field mapping integration is COMPLETE!**

**Files Updated:**
- ✅ `services/ghl_sync.py` - Uses field mapping utilities
- ✅ `app.py` - Shows trips & passengers in CLI output
- ✅ `field_mapping.py` - Already exists with all mappings

**What It Does:**
- Automatically maps 30+ trip custom fields
- Automatically maps 25+ passenger custom fields
- Handles type conversions (dates, numbers, booleans)
- Paginates through large datasets
- Provides detailed progress output

**Run This Command:**
```bash
cd /Users/ridiculaptop/Downloads/claude_code_tripbuilder/tripbuilder
source ../.venv/bin/activate
flask sync-ghl
```

**Expected Results:**
- 2 pipelines, 11 stages
- 53 custom fields
- ~5,453 contacts
- ~693 trips (with ALL custom fields mapped!)
- ~6,477 passengers (with ALL custom fields mapped!)

The sync should now properly capture all trip details (dates, capacity, pricing, vendor) and passenger information (passport, health, emergency contacts, room preferences)!
