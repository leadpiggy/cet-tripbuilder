In response to your question stated here:

"""Should we complete Stage 2A first?
Before moving to Stage 2B (creation), should we:
Option 1: Complete Stage 2A sync now

Add sync_trip_opportunities()
Add sync_passenger_opportunities()
Run full sync to pull in all 693 trips + 6,477 passengers
Then move to Stage 2B creation

Option 2: Proceed to Stage 2B (creation) now

Start creating new opportunities when trips/passengers are created locally
Come back to sync existing opportunities later

My recommendation: Option 1 - Complete the sync first. Here's why:

You'll have a complete picture of your existing data
Testing will be easier (you can verify against known GHL data)
You won't accidentally create duplicates
Your app will immediately show all existing trips/passengers

What do you think? Should we complete Stage 2A with the opportunity syncs first?"""

My answer: Option 1.

And remember: 
    1) That you have access to an extension that lets you read, edit, and write files directly to my computer. So, please go ahead and make the changes, don't wait for me to do it.
    
    2) Make sure you are looking on my computer in ~/Downloads/claude_code_tripbuilder/tripbuilder and not just in /mnt/project/ . look on my actual computer. Use the extentions I have enabled.

    3) The virtual env is in the root directory of the project which is ~/Downloads/claude_code_tripbuilder and it's in ~/Downloads/claude_code_tripbuilder/.venv/

Please read the attached file. It clearly shows an example where they filter by the field pipeline_id. If you read it, you would know that you need to pass it as a filter. like this:

""""filters": [ { "field": "pipeline_id", "operator": "eq", "value": "bCkKGpDsyPP4peuKowkG" } ]""".

Please replace with the passenger pipeline_id.  We aren't going to be able to link the trip and passengers right away.  We didn't have this backend setup yet, so we weren't able to automatically add the trip id to the passenger when it was created (because we didn't have the database set up yet).  Please retrieve the passengers first, then we will go back and add the trip info.  For now, look at the trip name from the dropdown custom field.  Also, we need to update our passenger schema.   The custom fields need to be mapped to columns with a mapping function as well that iterates through the list of custom value objects on an opportunity and maps them to the appropriate fields, and vice versa (reverse map).

Here is the appropriate table definition from another version of this we attempted:

"""CREATE TABLE passengers (
    id character varying PRIMARY KEY,
    firstname character varying(100),
    lastname character varying(100),
    email character varying(150),

);

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX passengers_pkey ON passengers(id text_ops);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX passengers_opportunity_id_key ON passengers(opportunity_id text_ops);"""

Also Trips is going to be the same.  here is a former schema from another attempt at this project:

"""CREATE TABLE trips (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    public_id character varying(36) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    name character varying(255) NOT NULL,

    description text,
    cover_image character varying(500),
    contact_id character varying REFERENCES contacts(id),
    opportunity_id character varying UNIQUE REFERENCES opportunities(id),
    status character varying(50),
    is_public boolean,
    max_passengers integer,
    current_passengers integer,
    base_price numeric(10,2),
    currency character varying(3),
    trip_vendor character varying(255),
    vendor_terms text,

    trip_standard_level_pricing numeric(10,2),
    passenger_count integer,

    is_child boolean,

);

-- Indices -------------------------------------------------------

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX trips_pkey ON trips(id int4_ops);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX trips_public_id_key ON trips(public_id text_ops);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX trips_opportunity_id_key ON trips(opportunity_id text_ops);"""

It's not the exact version we need, but it's a good starting point.  Please update schema, and re-run sync.
