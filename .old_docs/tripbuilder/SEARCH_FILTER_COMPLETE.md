```python
@app.route('/trips')
def trip_list():
    # Accepts query parameters:
    # - search: General search term
    # - destination: Destination filter
    # - start_date_from: Earliest start date
    # - start_date_to: Latest start date
    # - status: Trip status
    # - travel_category: Category filter
    # - min_capacity: Minimum capacity
    # - max_capacity: Maximum capacity
    # - passenger_search: Passenger name search
```

### Frontend Features

- **Multi-field OR search**: General search checks multiple fields
- **Join queries**: Passenger search joins Contact and Passenger tables
- **Efficient indexing**: Optimized for performance

## Filter Combinations

You can combine filters for powerful searches:

### Example Searches

1. **Summer beach trips with small groups**:
   - Travel Category: "Beach"
   - Start Date From: 2025-06-01
   - Start Date To: 2025-08-31
   - Max Capacity: 15

2. **Trips with a specific passenger**:
   - Passenger Name: "Sarah Johnson"

3. **Upcoming active trips**:
   - Status: "active"
   - Start Date From: (today's date)

4. **All Italy trips in Q1**:
   - General Search: "Italy"
   - Start Date From: 2025-01-01
   - Start Date To: 2025-03-31

## API Query Parameters

The filter system uses URL query parameters, making it easy to share filtered views:

```
/trips?search=italy&start_date_from=2025-01-01&status=active
```

All parameters are optional and can be combined freely.

## UI Features

### Filter Panel

- Animated card entrance
- Clear "no results" messaging

### Form Features

## Performance Considerations

- **Efficient database queries**: Only fetches needed data
- **Indexed columns**: Fast searching on common fields
- **Distinct queries**: Populates filter dropdowns efficiently
- **Pagination ready**: Structure supports adding pagination later

## Future Enhancements (Easy to Add)

1. **Saved filters**: Allow users to save favorite filter combinations
2. **Export results**: Download filtered trip lists as CSV/Excel
3. **More date filters**: Add filters for deposit date, final payment, etc.

7. **Pagination**: For large result sets
8. **Real-time search**: Live filtering without page reload (AJAX)

   ```bash
   cd ~/Downloads/claude_code_tripbuilder
   source .venv/bin/activate
